        <h1>Welcome to MindfulRecovery</h1>
        <p>A supportive community for overcoming cannabis abuse and promoting mental health. Here we work with people on overcoming one of the hardest addictions there is known to man. Don't believe me?
            Take a look at my life story. My life is an example of marijuana abuse gone wrong. I've been in hospitals trying to recover from a simple addiction to cannabis. The one thing inspiing me to create this website was a magazine I read.
            Magazine was called Mental Health Toolkit. And I want to practice my web development skills by creating a website dedicated to helping others.

Here we work with people on overcoming one of the hardest addictions there is known to man. Don&#x27;t believe me? Look at the statistics. Look at the resources I will give you. I am 22 years old, and I decided to quit marijuana after 7 years. It all started with smelling it. Smelling it was what lead me to go looking for it. However, I can accredit it to leading me up to the point of recovery and down the path of life where I can decide to turn around and help others as a service.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">I am a 22 year old addict. I have been addicted to marijuana and all kind of substances since the time I started Highschool. I had to suffer a lot and go through rough patches in my life to realize the main drug that is holding me down is the marijuana. It was my gateway to drugs and will always be the one holding me down. I ended up with schizophrenia and have to take medicine to regulate my neurochemicals firing in my brain.</p>
